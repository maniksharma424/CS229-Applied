ðŸ”¹ 1. Predicting House Prices (Linear Regression)
Problem Statement:
You're working for a real estate startup. You need to build a model that can predict house prices based on features like:


Number of bedrooms

Square footage

Number of bathrooms

Distance from city center

Age of the property

Goal:
Use Linear Regression and implement Gradient Descent from scratch to train the model.

Bonus:

Compare your model with sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression

Visualize loss over epochs

ðŸ”¹ 2. Admission Prediction (Logistic Regression)
Problem Statement:
You're given data of students applying to a university, including:

GRE Score

TOEFL Score

GPA

Research experience (Yes/No)

Your task is to predict if a student will be admitted (Yes/No).

Goal:
Use Logistic Regression and apply binary classification. Implement Gradient Descent to update weights.

Bonus:

Plot the decision boundary

Use accuracy, precision, recall as evaluation metrics

ðŸ”¹ 3. Email Spam Detection (Logistic Regression)
Problem Statement:
You're building a spam filter. You're given a dataset of email messages with features like:

Number of links

Presence of certain keywords (e.g., "buy", "free", "discount")

Message length

Uppercase word frequency

Goal:
Use Logistic Regression to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam.

Bonus:

Implement feature scaling

Use cross-entropy loss

Plot ROC curve

ðŸ”¹ 4. Salary Prediction Based on Experience (Linear Regression)
Problem Statement:
You're analyzing job market data. You need to build a model that predicts the salary of an employee based on:

Years of experience

Goal:
Implement simple linear regression (1 feature only). First with closed-form solution, then with Gradient Descent.

Bonus:

Try different learning rates

Visualize the cost function surface (loss vs weights)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Tumor Classification (Logistic Regression)
Problem Statement:
You're working on a cancer diagnosis tool. Given features extracted from tumor images:

Size

Texture

Symmetry

Compactness

Predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

Goal:
Use Logistic Regression for classification. Manually implement training using Gradient Descent.

Bonus:

Normalize features

Use confusion matrix to evaluate performance
